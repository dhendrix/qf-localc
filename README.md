# Qalydon Finance LibreOffice Calc Extension
Copyright Â© 2018 by Dave Hocker as Qalydon

## Overview
This project implements a LibreOffice Calc (LOCalc) addin extension that can
retrieve stock market data from various free sources. Currently, most of the 
available data is historical. This is a good extension for getting
historical OHLC data. 

There is no support for anything real-time or quasi-real-time.

The intent here is to provide a set of abstract functions that are independent
of the underlying data source(s). Previous LOCalc extensions I have written
are dependent on a specific data source (e.g. Intrinio or IEX). When
The data sources change, the extension functions are frequently impacted
and thus, any using spreadsheet is impacted. Some of the extension
functions are actually modeled on the data source's API.
And, worse yet, the T's and C's of the data source can change making 
the data is no longer freely available.

An example will serve to illustrate this point about abstraction. 
The first function to 
be implemented in this extension was QFClosingPrice. That function can
be implemented using any data source that can provide a ticker symbols's 
closing price for a given date. There's nothing in the function name 
or its parameters (a ticker symbol, category and date) that indicates
the actual source. If the initial implementation of QFClosingPrice
uses data source A and this source changes, the implementation of 
QFClosingPrice can be changed to use data source B without changing 
any using spreadsheet.

### Current Data Sources

* [Wall Street Journal](wsj.com)
* [Stooq](stooq.com)

### LibreOffice Compatibility
The LOCalc addin works on the Windows, macOS and Ubuntu versions of
[LibreOffice (version >= 5.0)](https://www.libreoffice.org/).

## Download
Download the latest **qf.oxt** (the add-in file) from
[here](https://github.com/qalydon/qf-localc/releases).

## Installation
1. Download the latest **qf.oxt** (the add-in file) from
[here](https://github.com/qalydon/qf-localc/releases).
1. Start LibreOffice or LibreOffice Calc.
1. From the Tools menu, open the Extension Manager.
1. Look through the list of installed add-ins for QFinance.
If you find it, click the Remove button to remove it.
For best results, **remove an existing QFinance
add-in first**.
1. Click the Add button.
1. Navigate to the location where you downloaded **qf.oxt**.
Select it.
1. Choose if you want the add-in installed for you or everyone.
1. Click the Close button.
1. If LibreOffice asks to restart, do so.

**It is recommended that you always remove an existing version of the
add-in before installing an update. Othwerwise, your results may be
unpredictable.**

## Configuration File
The extension can be customized using its configuration file. You do not have to 
create a configuration file. The extension will create a default configuration file
the first time it is used within LibreOffice.

The content of the configuration file is JSON and looks something like this (showing defaults).
```
{
    "loglevel": "debug",
	"cachedb": "~/libreoffice/qf/qf-cache-db.sqlite3",
	"datasource": "wsj"
}
```

| Key | Value |
|:-----|:-------|
| loglevel | error, warning, info, debug (default) |
| cachedb | Historical data is persistently cached in a SQLite database. This tells the extension what database to create and use.
| datasource | The extension can use several sources for data. See the [list](#data-sources) below.

The location of the configuration file depends on your operating system.

| OS | Location |
|----|----------|
| Windows | C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\libreoffice\qf\intrinio.conf |
| macOS | /Users/username/libreoffice/qf/qf.conf |
| Ubuntu | /home/username/libreoffice/qf/qf.conf |

###Data Sources 
| datasource | Description |
|:-----|:-------|
| wsj | Wall Street Journal web site (default) |
| iex | IEX Trading web service |
| stooq | stooq.com web site |

A word about data sources. 

The listed data sources are free. However, they reserve the right
to limit your use of their service. Therefore, your mileage may vary. In particular I have 
experienced problems with Stooq leading me to believe the site may have black listed my
IP address.

Also, each data source **does not** support every kind of ticker symbol 
(stock, mutual fund, ETF, index). The WSJ data source is the most comprehensive while
the other sources typically only support stocks and ETFs (e.g. IEX and Stooq).

## Example Files
You can find a number of example files in the
[examples folder](https://github.com/qalydon/qf-localc/tree/master/examples).
These files show you how most of the LOCalc Extension functions
can be used.

## LOCalc Functions
The addin provides a number of functions for retrieving market data.

* Opening price
* Closing price
* High price of day
* Low price of day

### QFClosingPrice
Returns the closing price for a ticker symbol on a given date.
```
=QFClosingPrice(symbol, category, date)
```

symbol: The ticker symbol for the equity whose closing price is to be retrieved.

category: stock, mutf or mututalfund, etf, index. The category is necessary
because some sources require it as a ticker symbol qualifier and it is 
difficult to determine a symbol's category from its ticker symbol. 

date: The date for the closing price in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)

### QFOpeningPrice
Returns the opening price for a ticker symbol on a given date.
```
=QFOpeningPrice(symbol, category, date)
```

symbol: The ticker symbol for the equity whose opening price is to be retrieved.

category: stock, mutf or mututalfund, etf, index. The category is necessary
because some sources require it as a ticker symbol qualifier and it is 
difficult to determine a symbol's category from its ticker symbol. 

date: The date for the opening price in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)

### QFHighPrice
Returns the high price for a ticker symbol on a given date.
```
=QFHighPrice(symbol, category, date)
```

symbol: The ticker symbol for the equity whose price is to be retrieved.

category: stock, mutf or mututalfund, etf, index. The category is necessary
because some sources require it as a ticker symbol qualifier and it is 
difficult to determine a symbol's category from its ticker symbol. 

date: The date for the price in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)

### QFLowPrice
Returns the low price for a ticker symbol on a given date.
```
=QFLowPrice(symbol, category, date)
```

symbol: The ticker symbol for the equity whose price is to be retrieved.

category: stock, mutf or mututalfund, etf, index. The category is necessary
because some sources require it as a ticker symbol qualifier and it is 
difficult to determine a symbol's category from its ticker symbol. 

date: The date for the price in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
