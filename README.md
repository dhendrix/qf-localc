# Qalydon Finance LibreOffice Calc Extension
Copyright Â© 2018 by Dave Hocker as Qalydon

## Overview
This project implements a LibreOffice Calc (LOCalc) addin extension that can
retrieve stock market data from various free sources. Currently, most of the 
available data is historical. This is a good extension for getting
historical OHLC data. 

There is no support for anything real-time or quasi-real-time.

The intent here is to provide a set of abstract functions that are independent
of the underlying data source(s). Previous LOCalc extensions I have written
are dependent on a specific data source (e.g. Intrinio or IEX). When
The data sources change, the extension functions are frequently impacted
and thus, any using spreadsheet is impacted. Some of the extension
functions are actually modeled on the data source's API.
And, worse yet, the T's and C's of the data source can change making 
the data no longer freely available.

An example will serve to illustrate this point about abstraction. 
The first function to 
be implemented in this extension was QFClosingPrice. That function can
be implemented using any data source that can provide a ticker symbols's 
closing price for a given date. There's nothing in the function name 
or its parameters (a ticker symbol, category and date) that indicates
the actual source. If the initial implementation of QFClosingPrice
uses data source A and this source subsequently changes, the implementation of 
QFClosingPrice can be changed to use data source B without changing 
any using spreadsheet. Of course this depends on both data sources
A and B supporting a historical closing price.

### LibreOffice Compatibility
The LOCalc addin works on the Windows, macOS and Ubuntu versions of
[LibreOffice (version >= 5.0)](https://www.libreoffice.org/).
Testing is performed on the latest general distribution release.

## Download
Download the latest **qf.oxt** (the add-in file) from
[here](https://github.com/qalydon/qf-localc/releases).

## Installation
1. Download the latest **qf.oxt** (the add-in file) from
[here](https://github.com/qalydon/qf-localc/releases).
1. Start LibreOffice or LibreOffice Calc.
1. From the Tools menu, open the Extension Manager.
1. Look through the list of installed add-ins for QFinance.
If you find it, click the Remove button to remove it.
For best results, **remove an existing QFinance
add-in first**.
1. Click the Add button.
1. Navigate to the location where you downloaded **qf.oxt**.
Select it.
1. Choose if you want the add-in installed for you or everyone.
1. Click the Close button.
1. If LibreOffice asks to restart, do so.

**It is recommended that you always remove an existing version of the
add-in before installing an update. Othwerwise, your results may be
unpredictable.**

## Configuration File
The extension can be customized using its configuration file. You do not have to 
create a configuration file. The extension will create a default configuration file
the first time it is used within LibreOffice.

The content of the configuration file is JSON and looks something like this (showing defaults).
```json
{
  "loglevel": "debug",
  "cachedb": "~/libreoffice/qf/qf-cache-db.sqlite3",
  "datasource": "wsj",
  "altdatasource": "stooq",
  "stooqconf": 
  {
        "tickerpostfix": ".us"
  }
}
```

| Key | Value |
|:-----|:-------|
| loglevel | error, warning, info, debug (default) |
| cachedb | Historical data is persistently cached in a SQLite database. This tells the extension what database to create and use.
| datasource | The extension can use several sources for data. See the [list](#data-sources) below.
| altdatasource | For future use. Eventually, this will be the backup data source. |
| stooqconf | Specific configuration for the Stooq data source. See [below](#using-stooq). | 

The location of the configuration file depends on your operating system.

| OS | Location |
|:----|:----------|
| Windows | C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\libreoffice\qf\qf.conf |
| macOS | /Users/username/libreoffice/qf/qf.conf |
| Ubuntu | /home/username/libreoffice/qf/qf.conf |

### Data Sources 

| datasource | Description |
| :----      | :---        |
| wsj        | Wall Street Journal web site (default) |
| iex        | IEX Trading web service |
| stooq      | stooq.com web site |

A word about data sources. 

The listed data sources are free. However, they reserve the right
to limit your use of their service. Therefore, your mileage may vary. Each of these
data sources tend to have their own idiosyncracies.

Also, each data source **does not** support every kind of ticker symbol 
(stock, mutual fund, ETF, index). The WSJ data source is the most comprehensive while
the other sources typically only support stocks and ETFs (e.g. IEX and Stooq).

In the future, other data sources may be added (e.g. Tiingo).

#### Using Stooq
If you want to use Stooq as your data source, you need to be aware of the ticker
symbols that it recognizes. By observation, most ticker symbols need to have ".us"
appended to the normal symbol. For example, the symbol "ibm" would be
"ibm.us".

Since you don't want to change all of the ticker symbols in a spreadsheet when
you change the data source, the postfix is applied by the extension. The postfix 
defaults to ".us", but should you need a different postfix you can define one
in the configuration file.

```json
{
  "loglevel": "debug",
  "cachedb": "~/libreoffice/qf/qf-cache-db.sqlite3",
  "datasource": "stooq",
  "stooqconf":
  {
    "tickerpostfix": ".us"
  }
}
```

## Example Files
You can find a number of example files in the
[examples folder](https://github.com/qalydon/qf-localc/tree/master/examples).
These files show you how most of the LOCalc Extension functions
can be used.

## Using LOCalc Functions

### Ticker Symbol Categories
Most LOCalc functions that use ticker symbols also require a category.
The category is necessary
because some sources require it as a ticker symbol qualifier and it is 
difficult to determine a symbol's category from its ticker symbol.

The standard categories are:
* stock or empty (as in the empty string "")
* mutf or mututalfund
* etf
* index

Some examples:
```
=QFClosingPrice("ibm", "stock", "2018-12-07")
=QFClosingPrice("ibm", "", "2018-12-07")
=QFClosingPrice("usibx", "mutf", "2018-12-07")
=QFClosingPrice("vym", "etf", "2018-12-07")
=QFClosingPrice("djia", "index", "2018-12-07")
```

### Standardized Index Names
Those data sources that support indexes tend to recognize different 
index names. To ameliorate this problem, each data source translates
a standard index name to a data source specific index name.

Standard index names are
* djia - Dow Jones Industrial Average
* spx - S&P 500
* nasdaq - NASDAQ Composite

Some examples:
```
=QFClosingPrice("djia", "index", "2018-12-07")
=QFClosingPrice("spx", "index", "2018-12-07")
=QFClosingPrice("nasdaq", "index", "2018-12-07")
```
